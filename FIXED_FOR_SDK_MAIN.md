# Fixed for claude-agent-sdk Main Branch

## Summary

The weather agent and other agents in this project have been successfully updated to work with the **main branch** of `claude-agent-sdk-python` instead of the broken `0.1.0` release.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)

**Changed:**
- `claude-agent-sdk==0.1.0` → `claude-agent-sdk @ file:///home/jcernuda/claude_agents/claude-agent-sdk-python`
- Added `[tool.hatch.metadata]` section with `allow-direct-references = true`

This makes the project use the local main branch SDK which has all the MCP SDK features working correctly.

### 2. Fixed Module Name Conflict

**Renamed directory:**
- `/mcp/` → `/tools/`

The local `mcp` directory was conflicting with the `mcp` Python package dependency. Renamed it to `tools` to avoid import conflicts.

### 3. Updated Import Statements

**Files updated:**
- `agents/weather_agent.py`: Changed `from mcp.weather_tools` → `from tools.weather_tools`
- `agents/maps_agent.py`: Changed `from mcp.maps_tools` → `from tools.maps_tools`
- Added `tools/__init__.py` to make it a proper Python package

## Verification

Created `test_weather_simple.py` which proves the MCP SDK tools are working:

```bash
uv run python test_weather_simple.py
```

### Test Results ✅

```
TEST 1: Get available locations
✓ Tool called: mcp__weather_agent__get_locations
✓ Claude's response: The available weather locations are: Tokyo, London, New York, Paris

TEST 2: Get weather for Tokyo
✓ Tool called: mcp__weather_agent__get_weather
✓ Tool result: Weather in Tokyo: 22.5°C, Partly cloudy, Humidity: 65%, Wind: 12.3 km/h
✓ Claude's response contains the actual weather data from the tool

VERIFICATION:
✅ Tool was executed and returned data
✅ Weather agent MCP tools are working correctly!
✅ Response contains Tokyo temperature data (22.5°C)
```

## What This Proves

1. **MCP SDK tools are being called**: The `@tool` decorated functions are actually executed
2. **Results are returned to Claude**: Tool results flow back through the SDK correctly
3. **Claude uses the tool data**: The response contains exact data only the tool could provide
4. **No hallucination**: Claude is not making up weather data; it's using real tool results

## Known Issues in 0.1.0 Release

The 0.1.0 PyPI release had issues with:
- MCP SDK server registration/initialization
- Tool routing and execution
- Missing or incorrect type definitions

All these are fixed in the main branch.

## Next Steps

To use the weather agent:

1. Ensure dependencies are synced: `uv sync`
2. Run the test: `uv run python test_weather_simple.py`
3. Or run the full agent: `uv run weather-agent` (starts FastAPI server on port 9001)

The agent now properly:
- Creates SDK MCP servers with custom tools
- Registers tools with Claude Code CLI
- Executes tool functions and returns results
- Maintains conversation state through the SDK client
