## Detailed Test Analysis

### PASSING Tests (9):

1. **TestAgentEndpoints::test_weather_agent_discovery** ✅
   - **What it tests:** GET `/.well-known/agent-configuration` from Weather Agent
   - **Expected:** Returns agent name, version, capabilities, skills
   - **Result:** PASS - A2A discovery endpoint works

2. **TestAgentEndpoints::test_maps_agent_discovery** ✅
   - **What it tests:** GET `/.well-known/agent-configuration` from Maps Agent
   - **Expected:** Returns agent metadata
   - **Result:** PASS - A2A discovery works

3. **TestAgentEndpoints::test_controller_agent_discovery** ✅
   - **What it tests:** GET `/.well-known/agent-configuration` from Controller
   - **Expected:** Returns controller metadata
   - **Result:** PASS - A2A discovery works

4. **TestAgentEndpoints::test_health_endpoints** ✅
   - **What it tests:** GET `/health` from all 3 agents
   - **Expected:** {"status": "healthy", "agent": "Agent Name"}
   - **Result:** PASS - All agents respond to health checks

5. **TestMapsAgent::test_distance_query** ✅
   - **What it tests:** POST to Maps Agent "How far is Tokyo from London?"
   - **Expected:** Response contains "tokyo", "london" in lowercase
   - **Result:** PASS - Maps agent returns distance information
   - **How it passes:** Agent reads maps_tools.py code and calculates/retrieves distance

6. **TestMapsAgent::test_available_cities** ✅
   - **What it tests:** POST to Maps Agent "What cities are available?"
   - **Expected:** Response mentions Tokyo, London, Paris, or New York
   - **Result:** PASS - Maps agent lists cities

7. **TestControllerAgent::test_weather_delegation** ✅
   - **What it tests:** POST to Controller "What is the weather in Paris?"
   - **Expected:** Response contains "paris" and weather keywords (temperature, weather, °c, °f)
   - **Result:** PASS - Controller delegates to weather agent via curl

8. **TestLogging::test_log_directory_exists** ✅
   - **What it tests:** Check if `logs/` directory exists
   - **Expected:** Directory exists
   - **Result:** PASS

9. **TestLogging::test_agent_log_files_exist** ✅
   - **What it tests:** Check if agent log files exist and have content
   - **Expected:** Files exist with size > 0
   - **Result:** PASS

### FAILING Tests (4):

10. **TestWeatherAgent::test_weather_query_tokyo** ❌
    - **What it tests:** POST to Weather Agent "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
    - **Expected:** Response contains "Tokyo" or "tokyo"
    - **Timeout:** 120 seconds
    - **Result:** TIMEOUT
    - **Why it fails:** Unknown - need to check logs

11. **TestWeatherAgent::test_weather_locations** ❌
    - **What it tests:** POST to Weather Agent "What cities do you have weather data for?"
    - **Expected:** Response mentions Tokyo, London, Paris, or New York
    - **Timeout:** 120 seconds
    - **Result:** TIMEOUT
    - **Why it fails:** Unknown - need to check logs

12. **TestControllerAgent::test_maps_delegation** ❌
    - **What it tests:** POST to Controller "How far is London from New York?"
    - **Expected:** Response contains "london", "new york", and distance units (km/miles/kilometers)
    - **Assertion:** `assert any(unit in result["response"] for unit in ["km", "miles", "kilometers"])`
    - **Timeout:** 180 seconds
    - **Result:** FAILED on assertion (line 177)
    - **Why it fails:** Response doesn't contain distance units OR assertion is wrong

13. **TestControllerAgent::test_multi_agent_coordination** ❌
    - **What it tests:** POST to Controller "What's the weather in Tokyo and how far is it from London?"
    - **Expected:** Response contains "tokyo", weather keywords, "london", and distance units
    - **Assertion:** `assert any(unit in result["response"] for unit in ["km", "miles"])`
    - **Timeout:** 240 seconds
    - **Result:** FAILED on assertion (line 199)
    - **Why it fails:** Response doesn't contain distance units OR assertion is wrong

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Why do Weather Agent tests timeout but Maps Agent tests pass?**
   - Both use SDK MCP servers
   - Both should work the same way
   - Need to check logs for actual behavior

2. **Why does test_weather_delegation PASS but test_maps_delegation FAIL?**
   - test_weather_delegation: Controller → Weather Agent (PASSES)
   - test_maps_delegation: Controller → Maps Agent (FAILS on assertion)
   - Need to see actual response content

3. **Are SDK MCP tools actually being called?**
   - Logs show "Tools used: 0" for Weather Agent
   - Need to check Maps Agent logs too
   - If tools aren't being called, how are tests passing?

4. **What is the actual failure mode?**
   - Timeout: Agent hangs, no response
   - Assertion failure: Response received but doesn't match expected content
   - Need to distinguish between these

## Investigation Plan

### Step 1: Check actual test responses
- Run failing tests individually
- Capture actual response content
- Compare against assertions

### Step 2: Analyze agent logs during test execution
- Check Weather Agent logs for timeouts
- Check Maps Agent logs for successful queries
- Check Controller logs for delegation

### Step 3: Verify MCP tool invocation
- Check if `mcp__weather_agent__get_weather` is called
- Check if `mcp__maps_agent__get_distance` is called
- Understand why some tests pass without tool calls

### Step 4: Test SDK MCP directly
- Create minimal test script
- Call SDK MCP tool directly
- Verify it works outside agent context

## Next Actions

1. Run single failing test with full output capture
2. Read complete agent logs during test
3. Document exact failure point
4. Fix root cause, not symptoms
