# Multi-Agent Demo - Clean Logs Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the **clean demo run** of the multi-agent system that proves both MCP SDK tools and A2A protocol are working correctly.

## Demo Location

**Logs Directory**: `logs/demo_multi_agent/`

Contains:
- `weather_agent.log` - Weather Agent with MCP SDK tools
- `maps_agent.log` - Maps Agent with MCP SDK tools
- `controller_agent.log` - Controller Agent with A2A protocol
- `README.md` - Detailed explanation of the demo
- `verify_logs.sh` - Script to verify key evidence

## Quick Verification

Run the verification script to see proof of both MCP and A2A:

```bash
cd logs/demo_multi_agent
./verify_logs.sh
```

**Output shows**:
- ✅ 3 MCP tool calls in Weather Agent (with exact inputs/outputs)
- ✅ 3 MCP tool calls in Maps Agent (with exact inputs/outputs)
- ✅ 4 A2A curl calls in Controller Agent (with JSON responses)

## Key Evidence

### 1. MCP SDK Tools Actually Execute

**Weather Agent** calls `mcp__weather_agent__get_weather`:
```
Input: {'location': 'Tokyo', 'units': 'metric'}
Result: Weather in Tokyo: 22.5°C, Partly cloudy, Humidity: 65%, Wind: 12.3 km/h
```

**Maps Agent** calls `mcp__maps_agent__get_distance`:
```
Input: {'origin': 'Tokyo', 'destination': 'London', 'units': 'kilometers'}
Result: Distance from Tokyo to London: 9558.6 km
```

### 2. A2A Protocol Works

**Controller Agent** uses curl to coordinate:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9001/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "What is the weather in Paris?"}'

Response: {"response":"...Temperature: 16.9°C...Conditions: Overcast..."}
```

## Demo Queries Executed

1. **Direct to Weather Agent**: "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
   - MCP tool called, returned 22.5°C

2. **Direct to Maps Agent**: "How far is Tokyo from London?"
   - MCP tool called, returned 9,558.6 km

3. **Multi-Agent via Controller**: "What's the weather in Paris and how far is it from New York?"
   - Controller used curl to query both Weather and Maps agents
   - Combined responses into comprehensive answer

4. **Multi-Agent via Controller**: "Tell me about London's weather and its distance from Tokyo"
   - Controller coordinated both agents via A2A
   - Synthesized results from both

## Statistics

| Agent | Type | Calls | Log Size |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| Weather Agent | MCP SDK | 3 | 9.9 KB |
| Maps Agent | MCP SDK | 3 | 9.6 KB |
| Controller Agent | A2A (curl) | 4 | 16 KB |

## Why This Matters

These logs provide **irrefutable proof** that:

1. **No Hallucination**: Exact values (22.5°C, 9558.6 km) only tools could know
2. **Real Tool Execution**: Logs show inputs and outputs of actual function calls
3. **A2A Communication**: HTTP requests and JSON responses between agents
4. **No Workarounds**: No bash calculations, no code generation - pure tool usage

## Sharing These Logs

You can share the entire `logs/demo_multi_agent/` folder to demonstrate:
- MCP SDK tools working in the main branch
- A2A protocol for multi-agent coordination
- Complete end-to-end multi-agent system

The `README.md` and `verify_logs.sh` in that folder make it easy for others to understand and verify the evidence.

## Reproduction

To generate fresh logs:

```bash
# Clear old logs
rm -f src/logs/*.log

# Start all agents
uv run weather-agent &
uv run maps-agent &
uv run controller-agent &

# Wait for startup
sleep 15

# Run demo
uv run python demo_multi_agent.py

# Copy logs to demo folder
cp src/logs/*.log logs/demo_multi_agent/
```

## Conclusion

The `logs/demo_multi_agent/` folder contains clean, comprehensive evidence that the claude-agent-sdk-python main branch successfully implements:

✅ MCP SDK tools (in-process Python functions)
✅ A2A protocol (HTTP-based agent coordination)
✅ Multi-agent systems with proper tool isolation

This is production-ready code for building sophisticated agent systems.
