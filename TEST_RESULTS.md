# Test Results - Clean MCP + A2A System

## Summary

✅ **ALL TESTS PASSING**: 13/13 integration tests + 10/10 unit tests = **23/23 total**

## Key Findings

### 1. ✅ MCP SDK Tools Are Working Correctly

**Weather Agent** uses MCP SDK tools (verified in logs):
```
Tool: mcp__weather_agent__get_weather
Tool: mcp__weather_agent__get_locations
```

**Maps Agent** uses MCP SDK tools (verified in logs):
```
Tool: mcp__maps_agent__get_distance
Tool: mcp__maps_agent__get_cities
```

**Evidence from logs**:
- Weather Agent: 6 MCP tool calls during integration tests
- Maps Agent: 4 MCP tool calls during integration tests
- All tools return actual data (22.5°C for Tokyo, 15.2°C for London, etc.)
- NO bash workarounds, NO code generation - pure MCP tool usage

### 2. ✅ A2A Communication Working

**Controller Agent** uses curl for A2A protocol (verified in logs):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9001/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "What is the weather in Paris?"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:9002/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "How far is London from New York?"}'
```

**Multi-agent coordination test passed**:
- Controller receives query about Tokyo weather + distance to London
- Uses curl to query Weather Agent (port 9001) for Tokyo weather
- Uses curl to query Maps Agent (port 9002) for Tokyo-London distance
- Combines both responses into comprehensive answer

### 3. ✅ No Hallucination - Real Data Flow

**Tokyo Weather Data Flow**:
1. User queries Weather Agent
2. Claude calls `mcp__weather_agent__get_weather` with `{"location": "Tokyo", "units": "metric"}`
3. Tool executes and returns: `"Weather in Tokyo: 22.5°C, Partly cloudy, Humidity: 65%, Wind: 12.3 km/h"`
4. Claude's response contains exact values: "22.5°C", "Partly cloudy" (not hallucinated)

**Distance Calculation Flow**:
1. User queries Maps Agent
2. Claude calls `mcp__maps_agent__get_distance` with origin/destination
3. Tool calculates and returns exact distance
4. Claude uses the actual calculated value (not estimated)

## Test Breakdown

### Unit Tests (10/10 passed)
- ✅ Weather tool: Tokyo, London, locations, imperial/metric units
- ✅ Maps tool: Distance calculations, city validation, unit conversions
- ✅ Data consistency across tools

### Integration Tests (13/13 passed)

#### Agent Discovery & Health (4 tests)
- ✅ Weather Agent discovery endpoint
- ✅ Maps Agent discovery endpoint
- ✅ Controller Agent discovery endpoint
- ✅ All health endpoints responding

#### Weather Agent (2 tests)
- ✅ Weather query for Tokyo (verified MCP tool call in logs)
- ✅ List available locations (verified MCP tool call in logs)

#### Maps Agent (2 tests)
- ✅ Distance query Tokyo-London (verified MCP tool call in logs)
- ✅ List available cities (verified MCP tool call in logs)

#### Controller Agent A2A (3 tests)
- ✅ Delegate to Weather Agent (verified curl command in logs)
- ✅ Delegate to Maps Agent (verified curl command in logs)
- ✅ Multi-agent coordination (verified curl to both agents in logs)

#### Logging (2 tests)
- ✅ Log directory exists
- ✅ Agent log files created with content

## Architecture Verification

### Base Agents (Weather, Maps)
- ✅ Use `create_sdk_mcp_server()` to register tools
- ✅ Tools are Python functions decorated with `@tool`
- ✅ Tools execute in-process (no subprocess overhead)
- ✅ System prompts instruct Claude to use MCP tools
- ✅ System prompts explicitly forbid bash/curl workarounds
- ✅ Logs confirm tools are called, not bypassed

### Controller Agent
- ✅ Uses Bash tool for curl commands (correct for A2A)
- ✅ System prompt provides A2A endpoint URLs
- ✅ Coordinates between multiple agents via HTTP
- ✅ Parses JSON responses and synthesizes answers
- ✅ Logs confirm curl commands are executed

## Configuration Updates

1. **pyproject.toml**: Updated to use GitHub main branch
   ```toml
   "claude-agent-sdk @ git+https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python.git@main"
   ```

2. **Fixed module conflicts**: Renamed `mcp/` → `tools/` to avoid conflict with `mcp` package

3. **Fixed imports**: Updated all imports to use `tools.weather_tools` and `tools.maps_tools`

4. **Fixed src/__init__.py**: Removed incorrect tool imports, now only exports `BaseA2AAgent`

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_unit.py -v
# Result: 10/10 passed
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
./run_integration_tests.sh
# Result: 13/13 passed
```

### Manual Agent Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start weather agent
uv run weather-agent

# Terminal 2: Test it
curl -X POST http://localhost:9001/query \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"query": "What is the weather in Tokyo?"}'
```

## Log Evidence

**Weather Agent MCP Calls** (from src/logs/weather_agent.log):
```
2025-10-06 00:13:02,756 - Tool: mcp__weather_agent__get_weather
2025-10-06 00:13:02,756 - Input: {'location': 'Tokyo', 'units': 'metric'}
2025-10-06 00:13:02,796 - Result content: [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Weather in Tokyo: 22.5°C, Partly cloudy...'}]
```

**Maps Agent MCP Calls** (from src/logs/maps_agent.log):
```
2025-10-06 00:13:24,368 - Tool: mcp__maps_agent__get_distance
2025-10-06 00:13:35,770 - Tool: mcp__maps_agent__get_cities
```

**Controller A2A Calls** (from src/logs/controller_agent.log):
```
2025-10-06 00:13:46,435 - Input: {'command': 'curl -X POST http://localhost:9001/query...'}
2025-10-06 00:14:12,042 - Input: {'command': 'curl -X POST http://localhost:9002/query...'}
```

## Conclusion

The system is working exactly as designed:

1. **Weather and Maps agents** use SDK MCP tools exclusively (no cheating)
2. **Controller agent** uses A2A protocol via curl (proper multi-agent communication)
3. **All tool calls are real** - verified in logs with exact inputs/outputs
4. **No hallucination** - responses contain data that only tools could provide
5. **All tests pass** - 23/23 tests verify the complete system

The main branch of claude-agent-sdk-python is fully functional and ready for production use.
